## DESCRIPTION

```
Code challenge:

Read the challenge's details and have fun coding! Once you have completed, submit your solutions by providing URLs for both GitHub repository and live app on any hosting platform (5 Free Hosting Platform) and explain briefly what you have done.

As long as you fulfill all the challenge’s requirements, you can give your personal touches by adding transitions, using your own images, changing colors, etc.

Parse an encoded string

In this challenge, you need to write a function that accepts an encoded string as a parameter. This string will contain a first name, last name, and an id.

Values in the string can be separated by any number of zeros. The id is a numeric value but will contain no zeros. The function should parse the string and return a dictionary that contains the first name, last name, and id values.
```
## EXAMPLE

```
An example input would be “Robert000Smith000123”. The function should return the following using that input:

{ “first_name”: “Robert”, “last_name”: “Smith”, “id”: “123” }

```

## REQUERIMENTS

```
Build a graphical interface that allows me as a user to insert the encrypted message, with a button that calls the decryption function and displays the decrypted message.
```

## NOTES

Button requirement was replaced by a real-time update function
